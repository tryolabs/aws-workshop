# EC2 instances

The API of our application will run on several [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instances. In the sections that follow, we will create one and deploy our API there using [CodeDeploy](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/welcome.html).

First we will create a role to allow our EC2 instances access to SSM:

1. Go to **IAM** under **Security, Identity & Compliance**.
2. Go to Role section and click Create Role.
3. In 'Select type of trusted entity' select **AWS Service**, then **EC2** and click _Next: Permissions_.
4. Search for `AmazonSSMReadOnlyAccess`, select it and click next.
5. Lets call it `<YourName>ApiRole`. 
6. Click create Role.

We have already created entries in the Parameter Store. In the future we will need encrypted variables, like the password for our database. For this, will create an encryption key to encrypt and decrypt those values. That encryption key will be attached to our admin user and to the role we just created, so only services that are setup to assume the role can get access to the decrypted values. You can read more about SSM and secure data [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/managing-secrets-for-amazon-ecs-applications-using-parameter-store-and-iam-roles-for-tasks/).

1. Go to **Key Management Service (KMS)** under **Security, Identity & Compliance**.
2. Select **Create key**.
3. Selct symmetric and click next.
3. Enter `<your-name>-workshopkey` as alias and a meaningful description like "this is the encryption key for the AWS workshop".
4. Click next step.
5. Select both your AWS CLI and console users as key administrators. If you are using your Tryo Playground account, it's just 1 user that can do both.
6. Click next.
7. Select your EC2 Role (`<YourRole>ApiRole`) and click next.
8. Click Finish.

In the future, if an EC2 instance with our new role wants to access an encrypted parameter, AWS will automatically decrypt it!

## Launch your first EC2 instance

We are ready to launch our first EC2 instance. We will create a standard EC2 instance, add a [startup script](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html) (which will run automatically when the instance boots) and finally create a [security group](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html) that will control the outbound and inbound in our EC2 instances.

1. Go to **EC2** under **Compute section**.

    In the top right corner, you can pick the region we are going to use. In this case, we will be using the same region that we used for the S3 bucket setup earlier, that is, `US East (N. Virginia)`.
2. Click on _Instances_ in the left panel.
2. Click on Launch Instance.
3. Look for Ubuntu Server (make sure it is Free tier eligible) and click Select.
4. Select `t2.micro`.
5. Click on Next: Configure Instance Details. Configure the following:

    1. Select our `<YourRole>ApiRole` on **IAM role**.
    2. On Advanced Details, select "As text" in User data and then paste the following bash script:
        ```
        #!/bin/bash
        export LC_ALL=C.UTF-8
        apt update
        apt -y install ruby
        cd /home/ubuntu
        wget https://aws-codedeploy-us-east-1.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/install
        chmod +x ./install
        ./install auto
        ```

        Be careful, if you leave spaces at the beginning of the script it will not work. So NO SPACES!
        If you are using another region, the bucket name in the `wget` line needs to be modified (see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/resource-kit.html#resource-kit-bucket-names)).
6. Click Next: Add Storage.
    1. Leave the default settings
7. Click Next: Add Tags. These keys will help us identify our EC2 instances running the API later.
    1. Click Add Tag.
    2. Fill Key with `service` and Value with `api`.
    3. Add another tag with Key `environment` and Value `prod`.
8.  Click on Next: Configure Security Group.
    1. Make sure the _Create a new security group_ option is selected.
    2. Write a descriptive name on the _Security group name:_ field. You cannot rename it later so choose the name wisely. A good name is `<your-name>-workshop-ec2-security-group`.
    3. Click Add Rule.
    4. In port range put `9000` and in Source `0.0.0.0/0`, and add a meaningful description. 
    
        This will enable incoming traffic on port 9000 from every IP, so you can "contact" your instance from the outside.
        
        If you pay attention, by default we also get a rule allowing inbound traffic on port 22, which we will use for SSH'ing to the instance.
        
        Also by default, outbound traffic (that is, traffic originating from your instance) will be allowed to any destination and port, but you can restrict that later by editing the outbound rules for the security group.
16. Click Review and Launch.
17. Click Launch.
18. When asked to select an existing key pair, choose `create a new key pair`, name it `<your_name>_aws_workshop` and click download. Store it in a secure place (`~/.ssh` is good, but make sure you `chmod 400` the PEM file so only your user can read it), we will use it to SSH into the instances during the whole workshop.
19. Click Launch Instances.

## Add Security Group inbound rule
1. Go to **Security Groups** under **Network & Security** (still on EC2 service).
2. Open the Security Group you created when launching the EC2 (`<your-name>-workshop-ec2-security-group`).
3. Click **Edit inbound rules**.
4. Add a new rule with type `PostgreSQL` (port `5432` should be set automatically). As source select the security group itself (start typing the name and select the one suggested). Note that this rule could not be added on the previous step because the security group didn't exist at that point.
5. Click **Save rules**.

---
**Extra mile:**

- Try `ping`ing your EC2 instance. Extra points if you get it to work!
- Connect to the new instance via SSH. The username is _ubuntu_, and try the `-i` flag to use the `.pem` file.

---
**Next:** create a [PostgresSQL database on RDS](/workshop/s3-web-ec2-api-rds/03-RDS.md).
