# Set up users on AWS

You will generate (or receive) credentials during this step. You should save these credentials in your password manager of choice. If you don't use one yet, take a look at [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com/): a fully featured and open source password manager.

> **TryoTip:** if you are using the **Tryolabs Playground AWS account**, this section does not apply. Please, read it anyway, so you have some context on what you would do with a bare new AWS account.

As you might already know there is a special account in AWS called _root_. This is the account used to do the initial setup for users, roles and billing information. It is recommended to create a user with administrator privileges for every day use and to [not use the root account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#create-iam-users) to login to AWS. Additionally, you should make sure you enable [Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/iam/security-status-activate-mfa) on your root account, and use an app like [Authy](https://authy.com/) as a second factor on your phone (Android/iOS).

Next, we are going to use our root account to setup 2 AWS users.

One will be used to access AWS via the console (web interface, so this will be your own user). The other will be used for accessing our account *programmatically*: we will create an **access key ID** and **secret access key** for the AWS API, CLI, SDK, and other development tools.

Every account has some associated permissions. It is a good practice to have those strictly limited to the bare minimum necessary, especially for programmatic access. Permissions are handled by attaching [policies](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html) to the user accounts. There, you can customize the access levels to various AWS services.

First we are going to create the user for the AWS console:

1. Login to your AWS account with the root user.
2. Go to **IAM** under Security, Identity & Compliance section.
3. Click on Users.
4. Click Add user button.
5. Enter a username and check the option: **AWS Management Console access** under the **Select AWS access type** section and then click next. You should also mark the option so that the user is forced to change his password on next login (pick a secure password!).
6. Select **Attach existing policies directly**.
7. Search for: `AdministratorAccess`, check it and click next.
8. Click on Create user. Copy the url and password that appear in the Success message.

Now, lets login with our new user:

1. Log out from AWS and go to the link you copied earlier.
2. Enter the username and password that was auto-generated.
3. Enter your new password.

After this, we can create the user to access AWS programmatically:

1. Repeat steps from 2 to 4 to setup a user.
2. Enter a username and check the option **Programmatic access** under the **Select AWS access type** section. Click next.
3. Select **Attach existing policies directly**.
4. Search for: `AdministratorAccess`, check it and click next. Of course, in a real use case, you would design or use a policy with more restricted access.
5. Click on Download CSV.

In the downloaded file, you can find the access key id and the secret access key. You’ll need them to [configure your AWS CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) in your computer (read the _Quick Setup_ section). If you don’t have AWS CLI installed yet, you can do it following [these steps](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html).

By default, the `aws` command uses a `default` profile. If you want, you can have multiple [named profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html).

**Extra mile**: set the `ViewOnlyAccess` permissions to the user with programmatic access. Double points if you do it with the CLI.
